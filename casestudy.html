    Millitary Warrior Support Foundation UX/UI Case Study
  </h1>
  <section id="intro">
    <p>
      
The Military Warrior Support Foundation aids in helping military families and veterans through multiple program options. This foundation can gain traction through its partnership with George strait and redesigning their website branding to look more authentic.

  We created a survey questionnaire and concluded the following findings.

<h2>
  Survey FIndings and User Insight
</h2>
<p>
  During our surveys we discovered that most people don’t fully understand what Military Warrior Support Foundtion does for veterans, and what their programs are. Therefore, we believe that there is no clear message that helps the viewer understand their goal and purpose, and that we might be able to help if we redesign the Military Warrior Support Homepage adding their mission statement, goals and programs in a way that will draw people, and inform them on the value of donating to this organization.

<h2>
  Competitor Anylasis
</h2>
<p>
  I ran a competitor analyasis to dive deeper into what this organization had to offer compared to other similar organzations. I found competitors through Charity Navigator,BBB Wise Giving Alliance and Charity Watch, I also went onto each of their websites to see what these organizations' programs did specifically to help veterans and their key differences in what each program offered.

  One of the main issues is not only the website's authenticity, but the MWSF has not disclosed their standards for charity accountability. Participants in these reviews are voluntary, but without this accountability and transparency it's difficult to know where and how much the funding is going to the MWSF organization.

<h2>
  Heuristic Evaluation and Redlining of the Original Website Design Layout
</h2>
<img src="./images/MWS Original desktop mmnav.png" alt="originalDTlayout">
<p>
  I saw a few inconsistencies within the main menu navigation and from our user testing we found people felt the layout confusing to interact with and navigate. The main menu navigation has no UI interactions and unclickable buttons with repetitive links in the header.

</p>
<h2>
  Ideation Affinity Diagram 
</h2>
<p>
Some of the commonalities through our ideation phase correlated to people who didn't know of or had seen this charity/ organization before. They would either donate time or want to know which programs their donation was going towards.

<h2>
  Problem Statement 
</h2>
<p>
  We believe that by redesigning the Military Warriors Support Foundation homepage to clearly express the goal will achieve more donations to this foundation.
</p>
<h2>
  Card Sorting
</h2>
<p>
  I set up card sorting to go over the main menu navigation and re positioned the layout to make it easier to read and click through.

Branding
  </h2>
  <p>
    I wanted to give TMWSF a clean modern look that is easy on the eyes while focusing on branding.

Keeping the patriotic color scheme in mind for button layouts and main menu navigation. I wanted to keep the donation button the same since it grabs your attention.

    New Main Menu Navigation After Informaiton Architecture Redesign
  </h2>
 <img src="./images/MWSF main menu 780.png" class="mainmeunav">
 <p>
  After we finished our user testing, I went back and validated our users' concerns through design layouts based on their feedback. I added icons to named button links and got rid of the repetitive programs option in the main menu navigation. This is the same layout used for our mobile prototype.
